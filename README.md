Identifying protein complexes with clear module structure using pairwise constraints in protein interaction networks

demo_real.m is used to detect protein complexes from human PPI network, and the final results are save in 'data/non-overlapping.txt' and 'data/overlapping.txt' for non-overlapping and overlapping results respectively. 

demo_synthetic is used to detect modules from synthetic networks (non-overlapping networks: LFR10002-10003; overlapping networks: LFR10006-10007) and the result is saved to the file generated by  'a = strcat(num2str(lambda),'.mat');save(a,'labels');'.
